            Deepest human impulse, the most profound desire and need for communication. But right now, at this moment,
          communication is changing. <b>Rosen Adelson run Digg</b>, social news website, the content of which is chosen by us
          devoted user community of millions. <b>Chad Hurley</b> meanwhile, is the co-founder of one of the planet's most
          insanely popular websites, <b>YouTube</b>, the online video sharing service. <b>Digg and YouTube</b> are part of a new
            wave of web services, each more popular than the last, all of which offer an alternative to old school
            media. The guys at both YouTube and Digg are believers in a theory known as the wisdom of crowds. In
            mid-1990’s to listen to music you have to go look for a record store and poke around in the bins, find the
          music you're looking for but <b>David Weekly</b>, Justin Frankel, cable Sasser and Steve Frank <b>music lovers</b> who
            started playing around with some obscure technology that put tunes together with PCs and the web. In the old
          days, music files were huge and unwieldy. But <b>mp3</b> provided a way of compressing the data into much smaller
            digital packet, and therefore making it easy to move back and forth around the net.

          His idea was called <b>Napster</b> and his name, <b>Shawn Fanning</b>. Napster allowed its users to let their PCs talk and
            share stuff with the computers of other users. This meant that as long as someone somewhere had an mp3 of
            the song you wanted, all you had to do was fire up Napster, type in the name of the song, and it would be
            downloaded onto your hard drive straight from theirs. Hilary Rosen in the RIAA filed a lawsuit against
            Napster won that promise to have profound implications for the role of copyright. In July 2001, a verdict
            was rendered, Napster had to be shut down immediately. The new thing is always just around the corner. And
          when it comes to social networking, the new thing is <b>Facebook</b> startup founded by the now 23-year-old Harvard
            dropout,<b> Mark Zuckerberg</b>. Zuckerberg’s case, the grand ambition is to create a service that captures the
            totality of human connectedness to create.

          Now, not internet and not web. Instead, it's <b>Craig</b>. That's Craig as in Craigslist, which acts as a kind of
            online notice board in 450 cities worldwide, complete with all the stuff you get in the classified section
            of any newspaper, job stuff for sale stuff wanted places to rent, places to buy gigs services, and of course
            personals, are free is why the newspaper publishers are in a tizzy considering the scale and global reach of
          Craigslist, <b>Craig Newmark</b> who runs his free to use free to post website out of this tiny San Francisco
          office, which was once his apartment. Like <b>Jimmy Wales</b>, the founder of <b>Wikipedia</b>, the nonprofit user
            generated web encyclopedia. Newmark is living proof, that the web is not just about making money. It's about
            setting communication free.
