            21st century humans have come up with an awful lot of entertaining ways of filling up the few free moments
            in our overscheduled lives. some folks say our obsession with shopping reflects a certain decadence, a
            certain self-indulgence. we're taking part in a noble tradition, the evolution of capitalism. But now a new
            phase of capitalism is upon us, the age of e-commerce. And by two of its seminal companies, <b>amazon.com and
            eBay.</b> It's easy to forget just how revolutionary these companies were when they first burst upon the scene
            back in the 1990s. The garage we're interested in today was the birthplace of <b>amazon.com</b>, was in suburban
            Seattle and belonged to a guy named <b>Jeff Bezos</b>. And when the web came along, he started thinking in a
            systematic way about its unique properties, and what kinds of stuff it would be ideal for selling. He made
            list after list, and always at the top was books. Bezos launched Amazon in the <b>summer of 1995</b>. Around the
            same time <b>Pierre Omidyar</b> was thinking hard about the web to today but one who had an interesting idea, the
            idea that would become <b>eBay</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the beginning, Pierre Omidyar and Jeff Bezos shared one thing in common. They thought of the web as a
            place to do business and not just goof around. some measure of success came to Amazon and eBay almost
            immediately, within months of launching a site. The growth of the internet is that the internet gathers
            momentum as it goes, which is to say, as the number of users increases, the usefulness of the network
            increases, and it becomes even more compelling over time for new users to join the network. Anytime that
            Jeff had the opportunity, he'd lower prices so that there would be more growth and quite unlike many other
            business executives who hold their prices to make more in profit. Absolutely essential to getting big fast
            for Amazon was convincing customers to trust it with some of the most valuable personal information, their
            credit card numbers. The Amazon and eBay IPOs made Jeff Bezos and Pierre Omidyar richer than crisis on paper
            at least.
        </p>
        <p>
            Virtually every day it seemed at least one new e-commerce venture was brought into the world. The Internet
            boom had now officially turned into a speculative bubble. But it wasn't the only financial media happening
            at the time. In 1999, the total number of internet IPOs was 250. But eBay and Amazon stood head and
            shoulders above the rest of the .com crowd. The lessons of both eBay and Amazon indeed, are that the most
            successful ecommerce companies did more than just use the web to sell stuff. They understood that you have
            to use it to get power to ordinary people in ways that are fundamentally different from the old top down one
            way one dimensional, one size fits all mass production ethos, that dominated business in the pre web
            economy. What made a survivor survive is the deep understanding and relentless focus on their customers.
