            <h3 style="color: #3b5998">Encapsulation</h3>
            <img src="Images/encapsulation.png" alt="Encapsulation Image" style="width: 300px; height: 250px">
            <p style="color: #3b5998">Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming
                (OOP). It describes the
                idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on
                accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent
                accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of
                variables are known as private variable.
                A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions,
                variables, etc.
            </p>
            <p style="color: #d55d11">
                In Calculator program, in all the Python files the methods are Encapsulated under the class.
                For example:- In calculation.py, class Calculation encapsulates method,__init__(),
                convert_args_to_list_float(), create(), get_result().
                To access any of these methods we will have to call class Calculation and then can access the method.
            </p>
            <p style="color: #3b5998">Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different
                sections like the
                accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handles all the financial
                transactions and keeps records of all the data related to finance. Similarly, the sales section handles
                all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                when for some reason an official from the finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular
                month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first
                have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular
                data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can
                manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”. Using encapsulation also hides the
                data. In this example, the data of the sections like sales, finance, or accounts are hidden from any
                other section.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #3b5998">Abstraction</h3>
            <img src="Images/abstraction.png" alt="Abstraction Image" style="width: 300px; height: 250px">
            <p style="color: #3b5998">An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows
                you to create a set of
                methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which
                contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. An abstract method is a method that
                has a declaration but does not have an implementation. While we are designing large functional units we
                use an abstract class. When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a
                component, we use an abstract class.</p>
            <p style="color: #d55d11">
                In Calculation program, calculation.py file is using an abstract method. First we have imported the
                Abstract Method and then
                we have declared it on the method which we have to make abstract. In this code get_result() is an
                abstract method. In the main method
                it is just returning True value. But other files have called that methods to give it its functionality.
                For Example: in addition.py get_result() is returning sum of the numbers.
            </p>
            <p style="color: #3b5998">
                How Abstract Base classes work :
                By default, Python does not provide abstract classes. Python comes with a module that provides the base
                for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC. ABC works by decorating methods of
                the base class as abstract and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract
                base. A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod.
            </p>
            <p style="color: #3b5998">
                Abstract Class Instantiation :
                Abstract classes are incomplete because they have methods that have nobody. If python allows creating an
                object for abstract classes then using that object if anyone calls the abstract method, but there is no
                actual implementation to invoke. So we use an abstract class as a template and according to the need, we
                extend it and build on it before we can use it. Due to the fact, an abstract class is not a concrete
                class, it cannot be instantiated. When we create an object for the abstract class it raises an error.

            <h3 style="color: #3b5998">Inheritance</h3>
            <img src="Images/inheritance.png" alt="Inheritance Image" style="width: 300px; height: 250px">
            <p style="color: #3b5998">Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties
                from another class. The benefits of inheritance are:<br>
                1. It represents real-world relationships well.<br>
                2. It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it
                allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.<br>
                3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the
                subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.<br>
            </p>
            <p style="color:#d55d11;">
                In Calculator program, in every operation file i.e., addition.py, subtraction.py, multiplication.py,
                division.py the method get_result()
                is defined with its operations performed in it. And in all the testing files i.e. addition_test.py,
                subtraction_test.py, multiplication_test.py,
                division_test.py, that get_result() method is inherited by importing that class in the test class and it
                is performing the operations which are declared
                in the normal operation files. So this is the example of Inheritance in the Calculator program.
            </p>
            <p style="color: #3b5998">Different forms of Inheritance:<br>
                1. Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called single
                inheritance. We saw an example above.<br>
                2. Multiple inheritance: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple
                inheritance.
                Unlike Java and like C++, Python supports multiple inheritance. We specify all parent classes as a
                comma-separated list in the bracket.<br>
                3. Multilevel inheritance: When we have a child and grandchild relationship.<br>
                4. Hierarchical inheritance More than one derived classes are created from a single base.<br>
                5. Hybrid inheritance: This form combines more than one form of inheritance. Basically, it is a blend of
                more than one type of inheritance.<br>

            <img src="Images/polymorphism.png" alt="Polymorphism Image" style="width: 300px; height: 250px">
            <p style="color: #3b5998">What is Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means
                the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types.</p>
            <p style="color: #d55d11">
                In Calculator program, get_result() method is the best example of Polymorphism with Inheritance. Polymorphism means one method having
                different functionality. In calculator program, get_result is an abstract method which returns nothing in the main file which is calculation.py.
                But in addition.py it returns the sum of numbers. In subtraction.py it returns the subtraction of numbers. In multiplication.py it returns
                the multiplication of numbers. In division.py it returns the division of numbers. This is how Polymorphism is used in Calculator program.
            </p>
            <p style="color: #3b5998">Polymorphism with Inheritance:
                In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods
                in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class.
                However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class.
                This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesn’t quite fit
                the child class. In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. This process of
                re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding.
