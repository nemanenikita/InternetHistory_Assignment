        <h3>What is Pylint?</h3>
        <p>Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding
            standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.</p>
        <p>If you’re coding in Java the compiler will usually lend a helping hand. But if you’re coding in a dynamic
            language like Python you’re on your own: you don’t have a compiler to catch bugs for you.The next best
            thing is a lint tool that uses heuristics to catch bugs in your code. One such tool is Pylint.</p>
        <h3>Why to use PyLint?</h3>
        <p>Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for code
            smells. It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks
            can be refactored and can offer you details about the code's complexity.</p>
        <p>A code linter is basically a program that inspects your code and gives feedback. A linter can tell you the
            issues in your program and also, a way to resolve them. You can run it anytime to ensure that your code is
            matching standard quality.</p>
        <p>Linters look at aspects of code and detect lints:<br>
            Logical Lint: tells about code errors, dangerous code patterns<br>
            Statistical Lint: looks at formatting issues</p>
        <p>There are many Python linters like Flake8, Pylint, Pylama, and many others. In this article, I will be
            talking about Pylint because it handles both logical and statistical lint.</p>
        <p>If you want to install Pylint from the terminal, this is a one-line command to do that.</p>
        <h3>pip install pylint</h3>
        <p>I have installed Pylint in my code editor, PyCharm. For that, you can go to Preferences > Plugins and search
            for the “Pylint” plugin. Install and Download it from the window and restart the IDE.</p>
        <p>Then you can set up the Exec path for the plugin so that Pycharm can execute Pylint every time user needs to
            inspect the code. For that, go to Settings/Preferences, click Other Settings, and then Pylint. Enter the
            PATH environment variable there and you are good to go.</p>
        <p>Now, you are done! Every time you run a code now, you can use Pylint to look for refactoring, convention, and
            other little warning signs.</p>
        <p> At the lower left, you might see 4 symbols (red, yellow, blue, red ), these symbols tell the user about
            “Errors”, “Warnings”, “Display Conventions”, and “Refactoring” issues in the code.</p>
        <p>Pylint is an amazing linter that you must have in your coding arsenal. Because code quality matters!</p>
