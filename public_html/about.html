    <p>DON'T think for a moment that this little look at the history is going to capture it all because it's happening
        right now, even as we sit here.'' That insight is courtesy of Dr. Robert M. Metcalfe, a computer network pioneer
        and technology pundit who holds forth in ''The Internet: Behind the Web,'' a new documentary from the History
        Channel.</p>
    <p>He's right, of course, but the hourlong program does present an extremely user-friendly snapshot of the initial
        development of the Internet and its influence and impact over the past 30 years. The show concerns itself with
        the early days of the Net; its most visible aspect, the World Wide Web, is brought into the narrative toward the
        end.</p>
    <p>While computer science can be a dense topic for prime time, this documentary distills the complicated history
        fairly well. The program wrestles technical concepts like packet sharing and the TCP/IP protocol into bite-size
        chunks that will go down fairly easily for the casual observer who doesn't know much about networks but is
        hooked on e-mail and online shopping.</p>
    <p>As ''The Internet: Behind the Web'' explains, the Soviets' launching of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 brought
        about an epiphany among complacent Americans, who decided that it was time to get serious about science, lest
        they fall behind and be conquered by the Communists. The space race was kicked into gear, as well as the federal
        government's interest in computer science. In 1958, the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower created both the
        National Aeronautics and Space Administration, for the rocket scientists, as well as the Advanced Research
        Projects Agency, for other types of government-financed exploration.</p>
    <p>One of ARPA's projects was the creation of a computer network that could withstand damage from a catastrophic
        nuclear attack by automatically rerouting digital messages to get them to the right place. The agency was
        allocated $1 million in 1969 to create such a network. That led to the eventual creation of the Arpanet, which
        begat the Internet.</p>
    <p>Unlike the subjects of many historical documentaries, many of the Internet's creators and benefactors are still
        alive. The program included commentaries by notables like Ray Tomlinson, the engineer who first put the @ symbol
        into e-mail addresses, and Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web. It is refreshing to see such innovators
        give their accounts in their own words, instead of seeing the usual treatment of still photos and
        voice-overs.</p>
    <p>The program covers a lot of ground. One point that would have been interesting to explore further was the
        influence of the academic community on the Internet's early culture. The cooperative spirit of those early years
        seems a far cry from the often-crass commercialism on the Web these days.</p>
    <p>Technically advanced viewers may find the show's script simplistic, but they are obviously not the target
        audience. Any Luddites watching get a chance to feel smug when a piece of trivia appears before one of the
        commercial breaks: ''On Sept. 2, 1969, the first message was sent between nodes on the Arpanet. It was also the
        first Arpanet crash.''</p>
