            Imagine a world without Google. To understand how we've come so far, how the web search miracle happened, we
            have to go back to the time before Google, to the story of the companies like<b> Yahoo and Excite</b> to pave the
            way for its existence and became its fiercest rivals. The source of countless great ideas isn't any company
            is<b> Stanford University</b>. And it's here at Stanford where the roots of search can be found.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Jerry and David</b> were goofing around, they hit on an idea that would become the basis for one of America's
            best-known businesses, and turn them into billionaires. Today, their company is called <b>Yahoo.</b> And it's among
            the most traffic sites on the web. You needed some kind of guide; you needed some kind of directory to kind
            of help you kind of navigate through Internet. This was a simple but brilliant thought, a directory that
            could show virgin web users how to find cool stuff and this new electronic world, but it was nothing like
            search today. Yahoo was a great idea. But a great idea isn't enough to become a great company. It requires
            money, and lots of it. Late in 1995, Yahoo began taking banner ads. Yahoo's users just kept on multiplying.
            And more users meant more advertisers paying more money to put their banner ads in front of the growing
            number of eyeballs. For the first time, Yahoo had shown it was possible to make money on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
            By<b> 1996</b>, Yahoo faced an assortment of challenges that were gaining ground on it most formidable rival was a
            company called <b>Excite</b>. Excite was pure software. When you type in your query, the service would crawl the
            web, finding pages that contain the term you'd enter. Although the search companies were having great
            success, they were also turning into something quite different from what they started out to be. the search
            engine companies stopped caring about search. You could spend all day typing in various combinations of
            words to find what you were looking for, and still come up empty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sure enough, it came from the exact same institution that had already produced Yahoo and excite Stanford.
            Once again, the name of the company was unrepentantly goofy<b> Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin,</b> Page
            believed that a link from one website to another is a kind of recommendation. And he and Brin built Google's
            infant search engine around that conviction. When Larry and Sergey launch Google onto the Stanford website,
            everyone who saw it & realized it was something special. Here was a search engine that cared about search
            again. If David Sheridan and Andy Bettelheim, didn't see the potential of Google, it was probably time to
            Google boys to get back to those PhDs. Page and Brin wanted to organize literally all the information in
            the world make it searchable and universally accessible. Founders had to hire people. They had to pay the
            people. They had to buy equipment, to house their service. And all of that required money. The obvious
            solution was involved the likes of Yahoo and excite with banner ads on their site. Page and Brin weren't
            against advertising, they just wanted it in a more user-friendly web form. What we now understand is the
            internet economy was being born with Google as its most essential player. In the previous years, the company
            had gone from zero to a staggering $3 billion annually in revenue, and it'd become a household name.
