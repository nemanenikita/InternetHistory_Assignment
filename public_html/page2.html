            <b>Mark Andreessen, Co-creator, Mosaic</b>, says that <i>“Internet back then was only for nerds, academics, researches
            and scientists and it was so useful for people who were using it, so I feel that everyone should be able to
            use it”</i>. So, he and his pal's started writing code to make web easier and more intuitive to use. They added
            images, pictures, audio and video capability. In fall of 1993, Illinois geeks posted Mosaic Online and made
            it easy downloadable gift to humanity.<b>James Clark, Co-founder Netscape,</b> when he saw Mosaic, he quickly
            became convinced. And he thought internet and www are the things that directing to that conversion. Soon
            Clark contacted Mark Andreessen and offered him a job in Silicon Valley, soon they became partners and
            started thinking about plotting the Mosaic into the business venture.<b>Bill Gates, Co-founder CEO Microsoft</b> ,
            thought that the <i>“information highway should be a toll road and the Microsoft could control all the toll
            booths, we would all have to pay to drive”</i>. Gates online system was called the Microsoft Network (MSN.com).
            Microsoft’s behavior was certainly extreme, but it was driven less by arrogance, by fear and insecurity.
            Gates knew that at any moment a small startup can rise can topple Microsoft just as it had done to others.
            Mosaic/Netscape people were ready with the new browser and to turn the internet into the future of commerce
            and communication.

            13 Oct 1994 Netscape's new web browser Navigator finally hit the streets, and it was an instant success.
            Netscape's sudden success was impossible for Microsoft to ignore. Suddenly Bill Gates got it, not just the
            importance of web but the scale of his own strategic wonder and the need to rectify it right now. Netscape
            bees began to think they were invincible. They treated even their allies with arrogant indifference and ask
            for their enemies. on <b>December 7, 1995</b>. Gates let the world know that he had Netscape in his sights.
            Microsoft launched web browser of its own<b> Internet Explorer</b>. The market share of Internet Explorer steadily
            grew. And Netscape started to feel Microsoft breathing down its neck. Rather than charging money for its web
            browser is Netscape had to Microsoft was able to give Internet Explorer away for free, bundled and
            seamlessly integrated into the Windows operating system. By September 1997, the browser war was over.
            <i>Microsoft had emerged triumphant. Netscape was reeling its business on the ropes, it's very survival in
                doubt.</i>
