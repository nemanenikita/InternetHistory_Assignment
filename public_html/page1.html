            The internet behind the web: -Computer communication can also be a tool of war e.g.: - UN did war against
            Saddam
            Hussein.<b> Dr. Vinton Cerf, Co-founder of TCP/IP protocols</b> says, <i>if you knew where the things were
            and what was
            available better than the opponent then you can organize your offensives</i>. The idea behind the internet
            was
            envisioned by a psychologist named <b>J C R Licklider. Dr. Robert M. Metcalfe, Inventor of the Ethernet</b>
            says,
            Licklider's vision was computers will allow you to communicate better and that will allow you to connect all
            the
            computers together so that they might be more useful in sharing information among people. The 1st computers
            were
            very large and expensive devices that were never intended to communicate. <b>President Dwight D.
            Eisenhower</b> created
            a burao department called <i>ARPA-Advanced Research Project Agency</i>. It was in charge of the space
            program, which
            included computer science.

        <p>
            At MIT a graduate student named <b>Leonard Kleinrock</b> began applying queuing theory for data
            transmission. As letter
            of post offices, Kleinrock showed how packages of data lineup or queue at the nodes of computer network as
            they
            transited through, this way he could determine the overall speed of the network. He then showed how to speed
            up
            the network by implementing 2 techniques.<br>1) Manned access <br>2) Distributed control.<br> Telephone
            communication is
            based on circuit switching technique, one telephone is connected to another through a circuit, if the
            connection
            path is broken then the call is lost. USA needed an indestructible communication network.<b>Dr. Paul
            Baran </b> was
            hired to build one. He started of playing with a fishnet type networks, so even if one link was chopped off
            there is still a path through the network. Dr. Paul Baran says, <i>“Coach Shannon in 1952 built a machine
            modeled a
            mouse finding his way through a mace, if we could model a mouse going through a mace then we should be able
            to
            do the same with the information.”</i> So, the information flows along with each of the packets is necessary
            to find
            its way through the network.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next borrowing an idea from <i>telegram</i>, Baran decide to chop up each message into all equal sized
            pieces called
            packets. Each packet was like a post card with to and from in address. Then Baran allowed each node to
            decide
            where to send each packet as to traverse the network. By 1962 there was enough research and theories to show
            that viable computer network could be built, but building one had to wait for 7 years until 1969. In 1966
            Bob
            Taylor of ARPA needed different terminals to log in to each of several time-shared computers at research
            centers
            across the country. No two computers could talk to each other. So, Taylor had to move from terminal to
            terminal
            to work on a different computer. He knew that single terminal could suffice if all the computers were in a
            common network. His notion was to create a network which will link heterogeneous computers to each other.
            Taylor
            recruited Larry Robert for the job as he built worlds 1st experimental connection between 2 computers at the
            MIT, Lincoln Laboratories. 1968 was a medieval time for communication technologies, and in the same year
            Roberts
            sort out the engineers to build ARPA's computer network. The ARPA net which grown to become the mighty
            internet
        </p>
        <p>
            How it works: -Suppose I want so send a long document, I feed it into the network, the 1st thing network
            does is chop that document into little pieces called packets. Each packet is launched into the network, and
            it tries to find its location into the network. At the other end final destination takes all the packets puts
            them back into a long document and delivers them. A small Cambridge Massachusetts company <b>Bould, Braneck and
            Neuman (BBN)</b> were willing to try ARPA net.<i>Sept 1 1969, 1st computer arrived at UCLA</i>. by the end of 1969 all
            4 sites were interconnected. In April 1971 the ARPA net had 18 main frame computers hold into the network.
            Earlier the computers were only able to send data files but then new capability was added which was Email.
            <b>Raymond Tomlinson, Inventor of e-mail,</b> 1st he was working on a mail program, but it was just for a single
            computer. He gave the world new icon <b>"@"</b> sign. Oct 1972 ARPA demonstrated computer networks in Washington
            DC, and this idea did take over the world. Later on, the network use started to increase, there were LANs to
            link computers throughout offices. And WAN (Wide area networks) to connect buildings across campuses.

            In 1973 Ben surf and Bob teamed up to set up set of rules or procedures knows as TCP/IP protocols. In 1983,
            TCP/IP was adapted as a universal standard- a common network for interconnected networks. Many private
            networks like Prodigy, CompuServe, AmericaOnline started to spring up so that individuals can join in. 9
            June 1992 Congress pass the bill and made internet available for public. In following November president
            Bush signed it into a law.<b>Tim Berners-Lee, Inventor of www</b> , around 1992 a physicist in Switzerland created
            an easier way to follow threads of information. WWW made internet more accessible
